    "Initialization: At the start, you have $10,000 in cash and can choose to invest in Stocks, Bonds, and Real Estate.\n",
    "Actions:\n",
    "invest: You can invest a certain amount in any of the three investment types.\n",
    "sell: You can sell your investments to convert them back to cash.\n",
    "exit: End the game.\n",
    "Value Change Simulation: Each time you make an action, the value of the investments is updated randomly to simulate market changes.\n",

    "This is a simplified version and does not include complex logic like market trends, more nuanced investment strategies, or economic indicators. It's designed for demonstration purposes.\n",
    "You can improve the complexity by adding features like historical data, real-time news impacts, or a more sophisticated investment strategy algorithm.\n",
